## **Test Scenario: Interactive Forest UI**

**Description**: You're tasked with creating a simple UI overlay in a forest-themed game. The UI contains several interactive buttons that each trigger a different event in the forest environment.

**Tasks**:

1. **Setup**: Use Unreal Engine to create a basic forest environment. This can be simple - a few trees and a skybox is enough.

2. **Creating the UI**: Design a simple User Interface using Unreal's UMG system. It should contain four buttons: "Day/Night", "Weather", "Spawn Birds", and "Reset". These buttons should be large enough for comfortable interaction on mobile screens.

3. **Button Functions**: Assign a unique function to each button.
    - "Day/Night": Toggles the lighting between a daytime and nighttime setting.
    - "Weather": Toggles the weather between clear and rainy conditions.
    - "Spawn Birds": Spawns a group of bird actors in the scene.
    - "Reset": Resets the scene to its default state (daytime, clear weather, no birds).

4. **Feedback Mechanism**: Add visual or audio feedback when a button is pressed, such as a color change or a sound effect.

5. **Cleanup**: Ensure there are no unused assets in the final project. Remove any default assets from the template that were not used.

**Submission**: Zip your entire Unreal Engine Project and submit it. The project should be playable directly in the Unreal Engine editor. The functionality should be tested and work both in the editor and when deployed to a mobile device.

**Evaluation Criteria**: The task will be evaluated based on the effectiveness and user-friendliness of the UI, the smoothness of the button functions, and the quality of the feedback mechanisms. Efficiency and cleanliness of the code/blueprints, asset management, and use of Unreal's features will also be considered.

**Timeframe**: You have 48 hours to complete and submit this task.

Remember, this task is designed to test your ability with Unreal Engine, particularly its UI capabilities, as well as your creativity and problem-solving skills. Good luck!
