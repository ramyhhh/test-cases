# My Technology Assessment Repository

Welcome to my Technology Assessment Repository! This is a comprehensive collection of test cases designed for evaluating the skills of candidates in various fields of technology. Our objective is to have the test cases reflect real-world scenarios as closely as possible, providing a truly representative evaluation of each candidate's abilities.

## Philosophy Behind the Test Cases

These tests are developed with two guiding principles in mind. 

1. **Relevance**: We believe that the best way to evaluate someone's skill is not by having them solve obscure, rarely-encountered problems (there are no 'black duck' problems here), but by presenting them with challenges that mirror those they would face in a real-world environment.

2. **Universal Application**: We have consciously made these test cases corporation agnostic. This means that regardless of your preference for a particular corporation's technology stack or way of working, you can still find these test cases relevant and valuable. This allows each candidate to showcase their best work, using the tools and environments they're most comfortable with.

## How to Use This Repository

Candidates are encouraged to choose any test case that is most relevant to their field of expertise or the role they're applying for. Each test case comes with a description of the problem, the expectations from the solution, and submission guidelines.

To submit your solution, follow the submission guidelines provided with each test case. We appreciate your time and effort and look forward to assessing your submission.

## How the Test Cases are Structured

The test cases are categorized by technology fields. This makes it easier for you to navigate to your area of interest. Each test case provides a detailed description of the problem, the expected outcomes, and any additional resources that might be required to complete the task.

## Use This Repository for Your Preference

While the primary aim of these tests is to assist in hiring decisions, they can also serve as excellent practice exercises for those looking to sharpen their skills or explore new areas within technology. Feel free to utilize these test cases as you see fit!

## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are always welcome! If you have a real-world problem that you believe would make for an excellent test case, feel free to contribute by following the guidelines outlined in the "CONTRIBUTING.md" file.

Based on this example, here are a few additional sections that could be added to the repository README to provide more clarity:

## Test Case Format

Each test case in this repository is meticulously designed to assess specific skills. Here's what you can expect from the structure of each test case:

1. **Test Scenario**: A brief overview of the problem you're tasked to solve.
2. **Description**: A detailed breakdown of the task.
3. **Tasks**: A step-by-step list of requirements for the test case.
4. **Submission**: Instructions on how to submit your work.
5. **Evaluation Criteria**: What we'll be looking for when assessing your submission.
6. **Timeframe**: The time limit for completing the task.

Remember, each test case is a chance for you to demonstrate not only your technical skills but also your problem-solving abilities and creativity. Take the time to understand the requirements before diving in.

## Expectations for Submissions

We appreciate quality work. When submitting your solutions, we expect them to be clean, organized, and well-commented. Make sure to remove any unused or unnecessary assets or code. Your submission should be as close to a real-world deliverable product as possible. Remember, the way you submit your work is a reflection of your professionalism.


Remember, this repository is designed to test your abilities in realistic scenarios. We hope that these test cases provide a valuable resource for your learning and career development journey. Good luck with your testing!
